### Behold JavaScript; --here we go;

In this project, I learned and practiced the use of JavaScript objects.

#### This directory contains all task solutions for 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures.

The following general requirements were followed:

* All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)

* All files are executable `r-x`.

* The `var` keyword was not used in any of the code.

* The first line of all files are exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`

* Each folder is for the respective task/projects.

* There were no errors and no warnings during interpretation. All warnings were rectified, and all bugs fixed.

* All JavaScript codes were `semistandard` compliant (version 17.0.0) ..

##

#### Code Editor used: `vi, vim`
