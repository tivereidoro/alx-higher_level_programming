### HTTP, cURL, methods, network connections --

In this project I learned; what a URL is, how to read a URL, HTTP, the scheme for a HTTP URL, what a domain and sub-domain is, how to define a port number in a URL, query string is, HTTP request and response, HTTP headers, HTTP message body, HTTP request method, HTTP response status code, HTTP Cookie, and how to make a request with cURL.

#### This directory contains all task solutions for 0x10. Python - Network #0.

The following general requirements were met:

* All Bash scripts are exactly 3 lines long (`wc -l file` prints `3`)

* All files end with a new line and are executable.

* The first line of all bash files is exactly `#!/bin/bash`

* The second line of all Bash scripts is a comment explaining what the script is doing.

* All `curl` commands have the option `-s` (silent mode).

* All files were interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version `3.8.5`).

* The first line of all Python files is exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`

* Code uses the pycodestyle (version `2.8.*`)

* All modules were documented: `python3 -c` <br> `'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`

* All classes were documented: `python3 -c` <br> `'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`

* All functions (inside and outside a class) were documented: `python3 -c` <br> `'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`

* There were no errors and no warnings during interpretation. All warnings were rectified, and all bugs fixed.
