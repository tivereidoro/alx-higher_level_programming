### Behold JavaScript; --here we go;

In this project, I learned the basic concepts of JavaScript language. I did some scripting and made the AirBnB project dynamic by using Javascript and JQuery.

#### This directory contains all task solutions for 0x12. JavaScript Warm-up project.

The following general requirements were followed:

* All files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node (version 14.x)

* All files are executable `r-x`.

* The first line of all files are exactly `#!/usr/bin/node`

* Each folder is for the respective task/projects.

* There were no errors and no warnings during interpretation. All warnings were rectified, and all bugs fixed.

* All JavaScript codes were `semistandard` compliant (version 17.0.0) ..

##

#### Code Editor used: `vi, vim`
